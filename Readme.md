Thinker AI Mod
==============

Features
--------

Thinker is an AI improvement mod for Alpha Centauri: Alien Crossfire. By patching the game to use an additional dll, new functionality can be coded in C++, unlike previous patches. Currently AI improvements include significant changes to terraforming and base production, among other things. The goal of the mod is to only improve AI behaviour without changing the game mechanics. This mod requires the [GOG version](https://www.gog.com/game/sid_meiers_alpha_centauri) of Alpha Centauri to play.
